I am a postdoctoral research assistant at the University of Reading currently working on the African SWIFT (Science for Weather Information and Forecasting Techniques) project with Dr Thorwald Stein and the CIRCULATES project with Dr. Chris Holloway. My main research interests relate to understanding and improving cloud-radiation interactions, in both observations and atmospheric models.

My work 

African SWIFT
======
The African SWIFT (Science for Weather Information and Forecasting Techniques) project aims to facillitate improved weather forecasting in tropical Africa. The project is a collaboration between several UK organisations and partner organisations in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal and is funded by the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF).

My research is focussed on remote sensing of convection and evaluation of it's representation in weather models. This primarily contributes to the evaluation work package led by Thorwald Stein. I also contribute to the Remote Sensing and Nowcasting work packages.
